Executive Summary
To gain insights into fiber artists by analyzing user, project, and store data from Ravelry.com. Research has found health benefits associated with repetitive activities such as knitting. Ravelry user data will be used alongside population demographics to attempt to determine if there are barriers to entry related to factors such as economics or age.
Motivation
Hand crafts have many benefits to the individual practitioner as well as to society. Research has shown that repetitive tasks like knitting can have beneficial health effects such as reducing stress and anxiety. There is also research indicating that performing a repetitive non-verbal activity such as knitting, crochet, doodling etc can help individuals pay better attention in meetings and recall information better than those who just listen or take notes. I want to examine data from a population of people who take part in these sorts of activities in order to determine trends among current practitioners as well as identify possible areas to expand the penetration of creative pursuits into new segments of the population.
Data Question(s)
•	Are Ravelry users representative of the ‘fiber enthusiast’ demographic studied by industry groups like TNNA? In what ways do they differ?
•	Does prevalence of fiber arts (knitting, crochet, weaving, spinning) in the general population as represented on Ravelry reflect average income?
•	How has the popularity of different fiber types changed over time? Yarn weights? Crafts represented on Ravelry?
•	Are there areas where there is a concentration of fiber artists/enthusiasts are located but no local store? Industry research indicates that knitters in particular spend more on average at local stores than online or at ‘big box’ stores so this could identify places where potential yarn stores could fill a market need.
•	Every yarn comes with a recommended needle/hook size – is that recommendation accurate? Does the accuracy change depending on yarn weight, composition, or experience level of the user?

Known Issues and Challenges
While the Ravelry userbase is relatively large for a niche social network, it is still small compared to world population, and most users are located in the US and Europe. This will probably limit my focus to these countries when analyzing links between population average income and prevalence of fiber arts.
